Psychometric networks provide information about the statistical
relationships between observed variables. ***networktree*** is a package
for partitioning psychometric networks to reveal heterogeneity.

Consider a depression network where the nodes represent different
symptoms:

***networktree*** can be used to identify if this depression network is
heterogeneous depending on the sample characteristics. For instance, we
can test whether the network differs depending on participantsâ€™ marital
status.

We can explore multiple characteristics at once, with the more important
splitting characteristics being prioritized in the tree model.
Continuous partitioning variables (e.g., age) can be included, and
***networktree*** will automatically search for the ideal split
point(s).
