Description: To reveal significant differences in correlation-based networks, also known as
             psychometric networks, network trees recursively partition the data with respect
	     to covariates and fit separate network models in the resulting subsamples. Two
	     network tree algorithms: model-based trees based on a multivariate normal model
	     and nonparametric trees based on covariance structures.
